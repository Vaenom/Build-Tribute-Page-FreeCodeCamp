      <h2> Every House Has A Superhero </h2>
      <p id="opener"> A biopic about my father </p>
    </header>

    <p>
      This generation and movie makers have vastly gloried the term
      <strong>"Superhero"</strong>. We see them as all-mighty with
      powers that science cannot explain. But,
      the truth is- <strong>not every hero wears cape</strong>. Anyone and
      everyone can become a superhero by contributing for the betterment. And,
      my father is a superhero too.
